/**
 * Mix this into another class to enable drop support and receive drops from {@link Core.mixin.Draggable draggables}.
 *
 * There are 4 basic methods that a droppable implements. These methods are called as drag operations occur:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class MyDroppable extends Base.mixin(Droppable) {
 *      dragEnter(drag) {
 *          // a drag has entered the drop zone... create some type of drop indicator perhaps
 *      }
 *
 *      dragMove(drag) {
 *          // a drag has changed position... update drop indicators
 *      }
 *
 *      dragDrop(drag) {
 *          // drop has occurred... process data from the drag context
 *      }
 *
 *      dragLeave(drag) {
 *          // the drag has left the drop zone... cleanup indicators
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * Instances of `Droppable` are associated with an element to receive drag operations:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  let target = new MyDroppable({
 *      dropRootElement : someElement
 *  });
 * ```
 * @mixin
 * @internal
