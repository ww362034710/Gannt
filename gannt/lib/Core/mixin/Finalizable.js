/**
 * @module Core/mixin/Finalizable
 */

/**
 * This mixin provides an asynchronous completion mechanism. This allows a process to coordinate its async actions
 * (such as Ajax requests or user interaction) with cleanup.
 *
 * Consider a context tracking helper class, for example:
 * ```
 *  class Context extends Base.mixin(Finalizable) {
 *      // ...
 *
 *      async finish() {
 *          this.owner.trigger('finish', {
 *              context : this
 *          });
 *
 *          // Wait for any scheduled finalizer to run...
 *          await this.finalize();
 *      }
 *
 *      doFinalize() {
 *          this.destroy();
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * When the `finish` event is processed, the receiver can register a promise for whatever processing it would like to
 * perform:
 * ```
 *  class Foo {
 *      onFinish({ context }) {
 *          context.finalizer = this.askUser(context);
 *      }
 *
 *      async askUser(context) {
 *          //
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 * @mixin
 * @internal
