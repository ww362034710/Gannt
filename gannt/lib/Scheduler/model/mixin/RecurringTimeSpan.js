/**
 * This mixin class provides recurrence related fields and methods to a {@link Scheduler.model.TimeSpan timespan model}.
 *
 * The mixin introduces two types of timespans: __recurring timespan__ and its __occurrences__.
 * __Recurring timespan__ is a timespan having {@link #field-recurrenceRule recurrence rule} specified and its __occurrences__ are "fake" dynamically generated timespans.
 * Their set depends on the scheduler visible timespan and changes upon the timespan change.
 *
 * There are few methods allowing to distinguish a recurring event and an occurrence: {@link #property-isRecurring}, {@link #property-isOccurrence}
 * and {@link #property-recurringTimeSpan} (returns the event this record is an occurrence of).
 *
 * The {@link #field-recurrenceRule recurrence rule} defined for the event is parsed and
 * represented with {@link Scheduler.model.RecurrenceModel} class (can be changed by setting {@link #property-recurrenceModel} property) instance.
 * See: {@link #property-recurrence} property.
