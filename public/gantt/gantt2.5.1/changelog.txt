    [API CHANGES]

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed various small bugs.

2.5.0     2014-11-10
    This Ext Gantt release introduces task constraints support and task split support. Over the years, these have been
    frequently requested and we are happy to tell you that these features are now fully supported. Additionally, we have added
    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the component. You can of course read
    all about the new features in our guide section of our documentation site.

   [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 4.2.1
    - 4.2.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - zoomToFit method now accepts right/left margins to fit labels (#1599)

    [API CHANGES]
    - The semantic of "ManuallyScheduled" field has been changed so that such task is only not affected by incoming dependencies
      and constraints. Also, the manually scheduled parent task is not affected by its child tasks positions and behaves like
      any other normal task. The holidays skipping rules are still applied to such tasks, according to it's (or project's) calendar.
      Previously the holiday skipping rules were not applied to such tasks. To re-enable the old behavior, create a 24/7h calendar
      in your project and assign it to such tasks.
    - The "Manual" value of SchedulingMode field is deprecated in favor of "ManuallyScheduled" field (so that task can be
      "manually scheduled" and has some scheduling mode in the same time)
    - The TaskStore#loadData method has been deprecated (as it exists natively in Ext JS 5.0)

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #1482: Resource model forEachAvailabilityIntervalWithTasks treats assignments calendars in a different way than task forEachAvailabilityInterval* does

    - Fixed #1592: Baseline % complete ignored

    - Fixed #1627: Selection model issues after filtering
    - Fixed #1628: Task availability iterator misses start/end dates for business time tasks
    - Fixed #1629: Task segments field should get into modified fields set after task move
    - Fixed #1631: German translation of dependency types
    - Fixed #1652: Histogram example tooltip enddate
    - Fixed #1677: Possible to create parent dependencies during inline editing
    - Fixed #1669: Zoom to fit works incorrectly

    [API CHANGES]
    - The `Gnt.widget.taskeditor.TaskEditor` class was refactored and instead of containing an `Ext.tab.Panel`

2.2.13    2013-11-20

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 4.2.1
    - 4.2.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Introduced new task properties - `successors` and `predecessors`, containing outgoing and incoming dependencies
      respectively. These properties cache the dependencies of a task, to avoid doing full scans
      of dependency store in various scenarios.
    - Implemented caching of the `hasTransitiveDependency` method, which makes the `strictDependencyValidation` checks
      more performant
    - Added a new `Gnt.plugin.TaskEditor` (and `Gnt.widget.TaskEditor`) config `assignmentGridClass` which allows you to
      provide your own implementation of the `Gnt.widget.AssignmentEditGrid` widget.

    [API CHANGES]
    - Implemented protection against cyclic dependencies during a "cascadeChanges" operation
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `hasIncomingDependencies, hasOutgoingDependencies, getAllDependencies`
      methods was removed
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `getIncomingDependencies` and `getOutgoingDependencies` methods
      was replaced with `doNotClone` argument
    - The `Sch.config.locale` option has been removed, as causing too many troubles with Sencha Cmd. Gantt now always "requires"
      english locale. Also, english locale now does not overwrite the other active non-english locale

    [BUG FIXES]
    - The "isValidDependency" method of the Gnt.data.DependencyStore now correctly returns `false` for transitive dependencies
    - Fixed #1033: problem with long projects
    - Fixed #1050: When normal grid is collapsed, normal grid should get a vertical scroller.
    - Fixed #1054: On replaceChild in some cases parend node shown as leaf
    - Fixed #1060: Changing the "% done" field should not trigger a cascade

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added new view presets "secondAndMinute" and "manyYears"

      start dates of the child tasks). Documented the previously private `allowParentTaskMove` option. See also "enableDependenciesForParentTasks"
      option in the Gnt.data.TaskStore class. (Fixed #169)
    - Implemented limited support for setting dependencies to/from parent tasks. Please refer to "enableDependenciesForParentTasks"

    For an in-depth review of the changes in this release, please see our blog.

    We have increased our test coverage too, if you find any bugs please report them in our Assembla bug tracker.

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    - New 'Gnt.column.AddNew' column added (showcased in the 'basic' sample) for easy adding of new columns to the locked grid.

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]

    "OverrideEndDate". This fixes a lot of issues with calendars CRUD. Calendar still can be loaded with the data in old format,
    but you should not rely on this anymore.
    - BREAKING: The internals of advanced calendar widget were significantly refactored. This feature was not documented so hopefully this change
    will not affect anyone - the public API remains the same

    more about the details of the upgrade process on our blog: http://www.bryntum.com/blog/road-to-ext-scheduler-2-2-upgrade-guide .
    The blog post will be posted shortly. There are a few API changes that might be breaking depending on how you're using the component.
